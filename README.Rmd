# surfcov

The purpose of R package `surfcov` is to enable covariance estimation for random surfaces beyond separability, proposed in the papers [arXiv:1912.12870](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.12870) and [arXiv:2007.12175](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.12175).

Let $X_1, \ldots, X_N$ be i.i.d. matrices of size $K_1 \times K_2$ representing discrete measurements (on a grid) of some latent random surfaces on a 2D domain, and $C := cov(X_1)$ be the covariance operator. The covariance is a tensor of size $K_1 \times K_2 \times K_1 \times K_2$, which becomes problematic to handle for $K_1$ and $K_2$ as small as 100. The assumption of separability postulates that
